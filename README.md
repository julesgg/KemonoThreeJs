# K'e-mono Interactive Visualization

This project is an interactive 3D visualization for the **K'e-mono**, my connected kimono project, an innovative prototype designed to analyze and enhance judokas' performance through integrated sensors. The application, developed using **Three.js**, enables users to explore a 3D model of the kimono and visualize its electronic components.

## Features

- **3D Interactive Model**: Navigate and interact with a detailed 3D representation of the K'e-mono kimono.
- **Sensor Visualization**: Highlight and display the locations and data flow of embedded sensors.
- **Customizable Views**: Adjust angles, zoom, and settings for tailored analysis.

## Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/): JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For structuring and styling the visualization.
- WebGL: Rendering the interactive 3D scenes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/julesgg/KemonoThreeJs.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd k-e-mono-visualization
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the visualization.

## Future Improvements

- Integration with real-time sensor data.
- Enhanced UI/UX for better interactivity.
- Support for mobile and tablet devices.
